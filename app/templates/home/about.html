			<!-- Introduction Content -->
			<p>Welcome to my site, My name is Chris Harvey and lately I am a Software engineer at Advent Resources in San Pedro, CA. Previously, I worked as a php programmer at PSC Biotech in Pomona, CA. Before that, I received my master degree in computer science at the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.</p>
			<p>During my job, I work on C, php and Javascript. I try to keep myself current with the new 
			technologies and trends, seeking training where needed and participating in events. My main interests at the moment lie in back end and server side applications and gain skills as a full stack engineer.</p>
			<p>I like blogging about computer science in general. I love building fast, performant, rock solid web interfaces/applications for the destktop and mobile.</p>
			<p>I enjoy and looks for challenging programming opportunities and good coffee. I am eager to learn new things and to improve every day.</p>
			<p>In my free time I like to watch sports game, cook and reading.</p>
